Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in the [HPArch Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/hyesoon-kim). My main research interest lies at the interesection of computer architecture, compilers and GPUs.

Before starting my PhD, I have previously worked at Arm, building GPU functional models for Arm Mali GPUs.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
