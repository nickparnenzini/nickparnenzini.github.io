Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in the [HPArch Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/), supervised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/hyesoon-kim). My research interests lie at the interesection of computer architecture, compilers and GPUs.

Before starting my PhD, I have worked at Arm as a software engineer in the Fast Models team, building GPU functional models of Mali GPUs.
